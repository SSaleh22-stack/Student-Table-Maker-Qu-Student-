You are a senior Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) + React + TypeScript engineer. 
I already have a Chrome extension project (Student Table Maker). Now add a NEW feature: 
AUTO-FILL the QU course review form on https://stu-gate.qu.edu.sa/*.

GOAL
On the QU review page (survey with many Likert radio buttons), add a floating widget:
- Dropdown: targetChoice = ["STRONGLY_AGREE", "AGREE"] (default: AGREE)
- Button: "Agree All" (Arabic: "موافقة للجميع")
- Button: "Undo" (Arabic: "تراجع")
When user clicks "Agree All", every question’s radio group should be set to the chosen option.
If user clicks Undo, restore the previous selections.

IMPORTANT SAFETY/UX
- Only run on https://stu-gate.qu.edu.sa/*
- Do NOT auto-run on page load. Only act after user clicks the button.
- Show a confirmation dialog before applying (EN/AR).
- Show success message: how many questions were filled.
- Leave text/open-ended questions untouched (only radio groups).

REFERENCE UI
I provided a screenshot of the review layout (Likert scale columns like: موافق بشدة / موافق / غير متأكد / غير موافق / غير موافق بشدة).

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
1) Manifest + Permissions
- Ensure manifest.json includes:
  - host_permissions: ["https://stu-gate.qu.edu.sa/*"]
  - permissions: ["activeTab", "scripting", "storage", "tabs"]
- Prefer a content script that is either:
  A) statically registered for these pages, OR
  B) injected programmatically when the user clicks extension icon.
Choose the simplest stable approach.

2) Content Script (core)
Create: src/content/reviewAutofill.ts (or similar)
- Inject a small floating panel (light theme) in bottom-right.
- Panel must support EN/AR strings (reuse the extension i18n approach you already implemented).
- The panel should mount only once (idempotent).

3) Autofill Algorithm (robust)
Because DOM may change, make extraction resilient:
- Find all radio inputs: input[type="radio"][name]
- Group by `name` (each question has one group)
- For each group, choose the radio to select based on the targetChoice.

Selection strategy (use best effort):
A) If the radios are inside a table:
   - detect the header row text and map column index by Arabic keywords:
     - "موافق بشدة" => STRONGLY_AGREE
     - "موافق" => AGREE (but not "بشدة")
     - "غير متأكد" => NEUTRAL
     - "غير موافق" => DISAGREE
     - "غير موافق بشدة" => STRONGLY_DISAGREE
   - Then for each question row, click the radio that is in the mapped column.
B) Fallback if table mapping fails:
   - If radios have numeric value, pick the maximum value for STRONGLY_AGREE, and the next (or second max) for AGREE.
   - Else fallback to DOM order heuristic:
     - Prefer the last radio in the group for STRONGLY_AGREE,
     - Prefer the 2nd last for AGREE.

When selecting:
- Prefer `.click()` to trigger all site listeners.
- Also ensure change event fires (if needed) using dispatchEvent(new Event("change", {bubbles:true})).

4) Undo
Before applying, snapshot the currently checked radio per group:
- Map<groupName, checkedRadioId or value>
Store it in memory in the content script (no need to persist).
Undo should restore exactly what was checked.

5) SPA / dynamic loading support
The review page might load content late:
- Use a MutationObserver or simple retry loop to detect when radio groups appear.
- The widget can always render, but “Agree All” should show: “No questions found” if nothing detected yet.

6) Connect it with the existing extension
- Add to the main dashboard a new card/section: “Course Review Helper”
  - Button: “Open QU Review Page” (opens a tab to https://stu-gate.qu.edu.sa/)
  - Show instructions in EN/AR: “Open the evaluation page, then click Agree All.”
- Store the preferred targetChoice (AGREE/STRONGLY_AGREE) in chrome.storage.sync so it’s remembered.

DELIVERABLES
- Provide the exact file changes:
  - manifest.json updates
  - new content script file(s)
  - background wiring if needed
  - dashboard UI addition
- Provide clear local testing steps:
  - npm install / npm run build
  - chrome://extensions → Load unpacked
  - Navigate to https://stu-gate.qu.edu.sa/* (logged in)
  - Use the floating panel to apply/undo

QUALITY
- TypeScript types everywhere.
- Small reusable helper functions:
  - groupRadiosByName()
  - detectLikertTableMapping()
  - chooseRadioForGroup()
  - applySelection()
- Clean, modern light UI.
- No major refactors to the existing codebase.
