# Correct Website URL

## ✅ Correct URL (GitHub Pages)

Your website should be accessed at:

```
https://ssaleh22-stack.github.io/Student-Table-Maker-Qu-Student-/
```

**Important Notes:**
- The URL is case-sensitive
- Make sure there's a trailing slash `/` at the end
- The format is: `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

## ❌ Common Mistakes

**DO NOT use:**
- ❌ `qu-students.com` (this is not your domain)
- ❌ `http://ssaleh22-stack.github.io/...` (must use `https://`)
- ❌ Missing trailing slash
- ❌ Wrong case in repository name

## 🔍 How to Verify Your Site is Published

1. **Check GitHub Pages Settings:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/SSaleh22-stack/Student-Table-Maker-Qu-Student-/settings/pages
   - Make sure "Source" is set to **"GitHub Actions"**
   - The site URL should be shown at the top

2. **Check Actions Tab:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/SSaleh22-stack/Student-Table-Maker-Qu-Student-/actions
   - Look for "Deploy Web App to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Make sure it completed successfully (green checkmark)

3. **Wait for Deployment:**
   - After enabling GitHub Pages, wait 2-5 minutes
   - The site might show "404" or "Not Found" until deployment completes

## 🚀 If Site Still Doesn't Work

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. **Try incognito/private mode**
3. **Check the Actions tab** for any errors
4. **Verify the URL** matches exactly: `https://ssaleh22-stack.github.io/Student-Table-Maker-Qu-Student-/`

## 📝 Current Status

- ✅ Code is pushed to GitHub
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow is configured
- ⏳ **You need to enable GitHub Pages in Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**
